A portfolio website should contain the following key metrics, that lets the visitor identify what type of individual you are and how you can benefit their company and their project. 
-	A clear statement of who you are what do you specialize in 
-	Your key skillsets and capabilities 
-	Any experience ranging from work to personal 
-	Projects that showcase your skills and expertise 
-	Services or job’s you undertake or do
-	Relevant background of what you have done from education to work
-	Contact section where the visitor can get in touch with you

With the following template in mind, the project was produced in the following manner and will be updated regularly to meet the ever-evolving changes of the industry and website requirements.

## User-Interface

It is detrimental to take in the User-Interface design of a website, so when the visitor visits the website they are greeted in a certain manner that will take them on a journey through your site. Particulary, a portfolio website should present it self as a journey into the life of the portfolio owner, who, what, where, why and how of them as an individual and what sets them apart of their counterparts (other developers).

## User-Experience 

User-Experience is also crucially important to how the website unfolds to the visitor, as it allows the individual to experience their feelings towards that platform. Personally, when i visit a website and something unexpected or something unique pops up or if i click it, i receieve this feeling of innovation and enjoyment of using an app. The personal Portfolio website is designed to deliver a unique and mesmirising experience to the visitor.
